            <p>In 2014, Our owner, <strong><em>Mr. Stephan</em></strong>, an executive IT engineer, started traveling to Asian. He wanted to visit Vietnam a long time ago. He came Vietnam in 2014.
                He walked into a coffee store, he was impressed by views and quality of drinks. They decorated specially, combined with traditional and modern space.
                Moreover, they selled with reasonable price, only $2 per cup, music was really deep, light and remarkable, lovely space from outside to inside. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After coming back Geneva, Switzerland, he wanted to open his business with Vietnamese coffeehouse tradition. In order to attract more clients and create new experiences,
                he combined Vietnamese coffee and modern European space. Customers really like this space and he has received so many positive feedbacks.

                <address>Mr. Sabino, American Traveler:</address>
                <p>"I really love space and quality of drinks. I love drinking a cup of coffee in the morning. I haven't ever tried a special views like this before.
                    Start a day with a cup of black coffee, croissant and see the sun rises in CH with light songs. It makes me feel like a paradise in here. I have 
                    an advice for everyone, if you haven't tried at 5:30AM in CH, you have to come Fresh Brewed Coffee immediately, It won't let you down and you'll be
                    satisfied with views, drinks, cakes and musics in here".

                    anyone come here feel that they're living in a beautiful with massive mountain in the behind of store and lovely lake in front. I have taken many pictures
